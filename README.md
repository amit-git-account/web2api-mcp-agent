# Web2API MCP Agent

An experimental MCP server that turns websites into callable APIs by scraping structured data and exposing it through MCP tools.

## MVP (v0.1)

- ✅ Supports Hacker News via a tool like `hn_get_top_posts(limit)`
- Returns structured JSON (title, link, points, comments)
- Designed to be used with MCP-enabled clients (e.g., Claude Desktop)

More coming soon.
